üî∫ What options can I use there? {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
‚û°Ô∏è In JSX, there are a few different ways to render a component:

    - {TitleComponent}: This is a simple way to render a component without passing any props. However, this syntax can only be used for components that do not have any children.

    - {<TitleComponent/>}: This is the self-closing tag syntax for rendering a component without passing any props. This syntax can be used for components that do not have any children.

    - {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}: This is the opening and closing tag syntax for rendering a component without passing any props. This syntax can be used for components that have children.

    - It is important to note that all three of these options will render the same component. The difference is in how the component is written and how it is rendered. If you are not passing any props or children to the component, any of these options will work. However, if you need to pass props or have children, you will need to use the opening and closing tag syntax.
